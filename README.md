# coffee
A site that can view all coffee informations in the database, with another page showing all comments for one kind of coffee.
# function
	Your site will need to use ‘ngRoute’ with two views on top of index.html:
		One view (coffees.html) will be a list of all coffees in the database, sorted by name;
		There should be a search box at the top to find a particular coffee;
		Each listing in the table should include a brand, a name, a location, and a link to see the reviews of that coffee.
	Once you click the link, it should go to the second view (reviews.html):
		This should be another table, of all of the reviews for the coffee list.
